        <p><em>Enthusiast of the <strong>web 3.0</strong> and web development.</em></p>
        <p><em>BSc, Mechatronic's Engineering</em></p>
        <em>Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.</em></p>
        <p>I have a bachelor‚Äôs degree in mechatronics engineering from the
          Santo Domingo Institute of Technology (INTEC). I began my
          studies in Santo Domingo thanks to a scholarship that its initiative
          is to populate the country with notable creative individuals and
          students who have obtained high grades during high school
          within the PIES program (Intec‚Äôs program for outstanding
          students). From an early age, I grew up interested in technology
          and I have always been fascinated by great figures of science,
          specifically inventors. When I was a child, every year I was trying
          to invent some new technological device or process before I
          reached the same age scientist that I admire began creating their
          own inventions throughout history to follow in their footsteps. In
          my free time, I like to learn new things that help me to understand
          many new technologies and recreate them myself following my
          fantasies and desires to know the truth nature's god creativity and
          also being capable of pushing the limitations of humanity. I am
          currently interested in Machine Learning, Data analysis techniques
          and Quantum Programming.</p>
